# Detailed Requested Slots

## SAV-based Anti-DDoS Architecture 

 * Presenter: Mingzhe Xing 
 * Duration: 10 min
 * Reading Material: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-cui-savnet-anti-ddos/
 * Motivation: I would like to request a 10-minute presentation on the draft "SAV-based Anti-DDoS Architecture" (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-cui-savnet-anti-ddos/), which focuses on enhancing security operations to defend against DDoS attack's using a SAV-D controller. This architecture leverages SAV devices to transmit DDoS threat information to the SAV-D controller, enabling it to comprehensively analyze, exploit, and exchange threat intelligence, ultimately improving network operations.

## Joint Exposure of Network and Compute Information for Infrastructure-Aware Service Deployment

 * Presenter: Jordi Ros / Luis Contreras (to be decided)
 * Duration: 10 min (it could be reduced to 5 min if necessary)
 * Reading Material: [draft-rcr-opsawg-operational-compute-metrics](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-rcr-opsawg-operational-compute-metrics/.)
 * Motivation: Address the problem of service operations when compute facilities are involved, from the perspective of considering both compute and network metrics for the service lifecycle (deployment, selection and assurance)

## IPFIX IE for GTPU

 * Presenter:  draft-ietf-opsawg-ipfix-gtpu-00.txt

 * Reading Material: [Draft: draft-ietf-opsawg-ipfix-gtpu-00.txt](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/ draft-ietf-opsawg-ipfix-gtpu-00.txt/)

## A YANG Data Model for Network Diagnosis by Scheduling Sequences of OAM Tests

 * Presenter: Victor López / Luis Contreras (to be decided)
 * Duration: 10
 * Reading Material: [Draft:draft-contreras-opsawg-scheduling-oam-tests](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-contreras-opsawg-scheduling-oam-tests)
 * Motivation: Present the updates of the draft

##  Intent-Based Security Management Automation for Cloud-Based Security Services

 * Duration: 15
 * Presenter: Mr. Jaehoon Paul Jeong
 * Intent-Based Security Management Automation for Cloud-Based Security Services [15 mins]

 * Presenter: Mr. Jaehoon Paul Jeong
 * Interface to In-Network Functions (I2INF): Problem Statement
 * Reading Material: draft-jeong-opsawg-i2inf-problem-statement-01, https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-jeong-opsawg-i2inf-problem-statement/

 * A Framework for Interface to In-Network Functions (I2INF)
 * Reading Material draft-jeong-opsawg-i2inf-framework-01: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-jeong-opsawg-i2inf-framework/
 
 ## Data Manifest

 * Presenter: Jean Quilbeuf
 * Duration: 10
 * Reading Material: draft-ietf-opsawg-collected-data-manifest-05
 
 ## Discard Model
